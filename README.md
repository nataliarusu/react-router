        npm install react-router-dom

router package allows to handle url without fetching new html pages. We should add routing tool to our code, it will watch url changing and we should let the router know wich component should be loaded for each route(for each url).

#### NOTE error 

The error ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED has been mentioned in the release notes for Node.js 17.

        opensslErrorStack: [ 'error:03000086:digital envelope routines::initialization error' ],
        library: 'digital envelope routines',
        reason: 'unsupported',
        code: 'ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED'
#### Solution
As a workaround solution you can fix this by using the legacy provider for openssl. So, you need to edit the package.json file under your applicationâ€™s root directory and check for the following lines and replace them accordingly.

        replace "start": "react-scripts start" by
        "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start"
        replace "build": "react-scripts build" by 
        "build": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider build"


# BrowserRouter

1. create new folder next to components folder "pages". In "pages" folder we will store components that will be loaded as pages when certain urls are visited. At the end the components will be the regular react components.
2. in index.js we should wrap <App> with router. BrowserRouter is a component itself. BrowserRouter is a React Context. React Context is a way to manage state globally. It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.

    
        import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
        
        <BrowserRouter><App/></BrowserRouter> 
    

So now we initialize our router package, we make it aware about this App and watches our url<br>


3  in App.js component we should define which components should be loaded for different paths. Route component of 'react-router-dom' job is to listen to different paths and wich components should be loaded for different paths

        import {Route, Routes} from 'react-router-dom';

        <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<AllMeetups />} />
           <Route path="/new-meetups" element={<NewMeetups />}/>
           <Route path="/favorites" element={ <Favorites />}/>     
        </Routes>

<b>Routes</b>- A container for a nested tree of elements that renders the branch that best matches the current location.

<b>Route</b> - Declares an element that should be rendered at a certain URL path.

The path attribute is a path after domain. So if we visit localhost:3000/new-meetups it will display the component between Route component tag <code> NewMeetups</code>.
The element is a Component that should be rendered in a specific path. So this element associated with this path

when we visit localhost:3000/favorites the Favorites component will be displayed


<b>Link</b> component is used to create links to different routes.
Link component is used instead of <code>a</code> tag for naviagtion because <code>a</code> will send a new request to the server, while Link is technically <code>a</code> but it won't send any requests. Link is another component of react-router-dom and we should import it. Link has <code>to</code> prop as <code>href</code> attribute for <code>a</code>. Internaly react-router-dom attaches click listener to Link component and it will prevent default sending request, change url bar but will load appropriate component/changes content but don't refresh the page.

        <div>
         <nav>
           <ul>
              <li><Link to='/'>Home</Link></li>
              <li><Link to='/all-meetups'>All Meetups</Link></li>
              <li><Link to='/favorites'>Favorites</Link></li>
              <li><Link to='/new-meetups'>New Meetups</Link></li>
           </ul>
         </nav>
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/new-meetups" element={<NewMeetups />}/>
           <Route path="/favorites" element={ <Favorites />}/>
           <Route path="/all-meetups" element={<AllMeetups />} />
           <Route path="/" element={<h1>Hi</h1>} />     
         </Routes>
        </div>


The nav we are rending at the top of our page is outside of our Routes component which means when we change pages this nav section will not be re-rendered as only the content in the Routes component will change when the URL changes.


## React Router five main techniques

1. Dynamic Routing
2. Routing Priority
3. Nested Routes
4. Multiple Routes
5. useRoutes Hook

### Dynamic Routing

        <Route path='/book-list/:id' element={<Book/>}/>



we have an url that goes /book-list/ and then (:) it has something afterwords. In this case id. The (:) signify that it isn't a part of url that hardcoded, it indicates /book-list/ anything. eg /book-list/1. The (:) won't be a part of url, it is indicator for react router that something will be after /book-list/.

Pretty much always when we have a dynamic route like this we want to access the dynamic value in our custom component which is where the useParams hook comes in.

        import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

        function Book(){
         const {id} = useParams();
         return <div>Book {id}</div>
        }

        export default Book;

The useParams hook takes no parameters and will return an object with keys that match the dynamic parameters in your route. In our case our dynamic parameter is :id so the useParams hook will return an object that has a key of id and the value of that key will be the actual id in our URL. For example, if our URL was /books/3 our page would render Book 3.

### Routing Priority

        <Route path="/books/:id" element={<Book />} />
        <Route path="/books/new" element={<NewBook />} />

version 6 of React Router changed so now React Router will use an algorithm to determine which route is most likely the the one you want. In our case we obviously want to render the /books/new route so React Router will select that route for us. The actual way this algorithm works is very similar to CSS specificity since it will try to determine which route that matches our URL is the most specific (has the least amount of dynamic elements) and it will select that route.

        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />

A * will match anything at all which makes it perfect for things like a 404 page. A route that contains a * will also be less specific than anything else so it never accidentally match a * route when another route would have also matched.


### Nested Routes

        <Routes>
                <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                <Route path="/books">
                        <Route index element={<BookList />} />
                        <Route path=":id" element={<Book />} />
                        <Route path="new" element={<NewBook />} />
                </Route>
                <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
        </Routes>

All you need to do is make a parent Route that has the path prop set to the shared path for all your child Route components. Then inside the parent Route you can put all the child Route components. The only difference is that the path prop of the child Route components no longer includes the shared /books route. Also, the route for /books is replaced with a Route component that has no path prop, but instead has an index prop. All this is saying is that the path of the index Route is the same as the parent Route.
